So the only way to turn off my program is to go into task manager and end task.
This will  be necassary when you randomly get the one form that crashes the program
and infinitly shoots up error messages. The program itself is on a loop so you will return to the
beginning (because what I originally wanted to do fell through the cracks :/) but eventually you'll
hit that infinite error message loop.
